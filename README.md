## Sentiments Seminar
This is the GitHub repository associated with our seminar on sentiment analysis using `R`. This was given as part of the Digital Humanities' Fall 2017 seminar series. We'll be using examples from Julia Silge and David Robinson's awesome book [*Tidy Text Mining with `R`*](http://tidytextmining.com). You can get it for free online, or pick up a physical copy from Amazon and other retailers.
